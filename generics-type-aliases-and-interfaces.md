# Generics, Type Aliases and Interfaces

### Type Aliases & Union Types: 

Type aliases are convenient ways to **store a particular type to re-use it throughout our programme** - in practice, it's the same as re-writing the actual type again and again. For instance:

```
type Cat = {
    name: string,
    colour: string
};

const sigrid : Cat = { name: "Sigrid", colour: "Tortie" };

//The code above is the same as the following: 

const izzy : { name: string, colour: string } = { name: "Izzy", colour: "Black and white" };

```

If we want to create more than one cat throughout our programme though, it makes a lot of sense to create a custom type and give it an alias name like "Cat" in the example above. Type aliases can be given to any type, including union types: 

```
type StringAlias = string;
type NumberAlias = number;

type StringOrNum = StringAlias | NumberAlias;
```

Aliases are also just that - they are not a distinct version of the type they represent. For instance, building on the example above: 

```
const isItString = ( input: StringOrNum ): StringOrNum =>  {
    return input;
}

let string : string = "string"

isItString(string); => Won't throw an error even though I didn't pass an argument of type StringAlias directly, StringAlias represents a string, so that's not incorrect.
```

StringAlias is just a **representation** of the type "string", renamed for our convenience. As far as the compiler is concerned, it's the same as the type "string". Properties can be made optional using "?" - this means is that if the property is set, it should have a specific type: 

```
type Cat = {
    name: string,
    colour: string,
    age?: number
};

const sigrid : Cat = { name: "Sigrid", colour: "Tortie", age: "9"}
// => This will throw an error, because "age" is set to the wrong type, even if it's technically optional. 

```

### Practicing with Type Aliases & Union Types: 

Implement a function to calculate the area of a rectangle or a circle. 

- It should take a parameter of custom "Shape" type, which itself should be a union type of either "Rectangle" or "Circle" type.
- It should return the area of the shape passed as an argument. 
- It should throw an error if the type passed to the function isn't "Shape".
- It should throw an error if the width, length and radius properties of the types Rectangle and Circle aren't numbers.

<br>
As a quick reminder, here are the formulas you'll need (we'll use 3.14 for Pi): 

```
Area of a rectangle = length Ã— width .

Area of a circle = 3.14 * square radius

```

Here is an example of what you should get if running the code: 

```
const rectangle: Rectangle = { width: 5, length: 10 }

console.log(calculateArea(rectangle)); 
// Expected output: 50

const circle: Circle = { radius: 10 }

console.log(calculateArea(circle))
//Expected output: 314

const rectangle: Rectangle = { width: "5", length: "10" }
// should throw an error

const circle: Circle = { radius: "radius" }
// should throw an error

console.log(calculateArea({ random: "object" }))
//should throw an error
```

Your code should be tested using Jest. 

### Interfaces & Intersection Types: 

Interfaces are essentially named object types - for instance, these three ways of typing are very similar: 

```
const sigrid : { name: string, age: number } = { name: "Sigrid", age: 9 };

interface Cat {
    name: string, 
    age: number
} 

type Cat {
    name: string, 
    age: number
}
```
Interfaces, unlike types, **are open ended**, which means that **properties can added after they are initialised**, as they function like objects. Types, on the other hand, once declared with an alias and initialised, cannot be changed. 

Interfaces also have some features that types on their own do not, such as, for instance, the ability to **extend from another interface or type** (a type cannot extend from an interface):

```
type Animal {
    isWild: boolean 
}
// type Animal extends interface x would not compile, because types cannot be extended. 

interface Pet extends Animal {
    name: string, 
    age: number
}
// This works because Pet is an interface extending from the type Animal, not the other way around.

interface Cat extends Pet {
    colour: string,
    indoorsOnly: boolean
}
// Cat is an interface extending from another interface, and inherits everything from Pet, including what it took from Animal.

```

We touched upon union types before, and it is possible to use interfaces to build them up: 

```
interface Pet {
    name: string, 
    age: number,
    colour: string,
}

interface Cat extends Pet {
    indoorsOnly: boolean
}

interface Dog extends Pet {
    likesBellyRubs: boolean
} 

type CatOrDog = Cat | Dog; 
// Any value typed as CatOrDog can now be of either type. 
```
There is another powerful tool you can use with Typescript, called **intersection types**. These are a bit similar to using the "extend" keyboard, because they will let you create a type that **combines several interfaces/types together**, as opposed to giving different alternatives like union types do. These allow you to **save new types under aliases**, whereas the **extend keyword preserves the interface's distict properties**, such as the ability to add to it later on in you programme. 

```
interface Pet {
    name: string, 
    age: number,
    colour: string,
}

interface Cat {
    indoorsOnly: boolean
}

type PetCat = Pet & Cat; 
// PetCat is { name: string, age: number, colour: string, indoorsOnly: boolean }

type Dog {
    likesBellyRubs: boolean;
}

type PetDog = Pet & Dog;
// You can mix types and interfaces with intersection type to build up custom types. 
```

Intersection types can for instance be really useful in functions where you want the argument to have characteristics shared across multiple types/interfaces:

```
interface Pet {
    name: string, 
    age: number,
    colour: string,
}

interface Cat { 
    indoorsOnly: boolean
}

const isItIndoorCat = ( arg: Pet & Cat ) : boolean => {
    if( arg.indoorsOnly === true ) {
        return true;
    }

    return false;
}
//This function expects an argument structured like so: { name: string, age: number, colour: string, indoorsOnly: bolean }
```

### Generics: 

Generics allow you to write functions, classes and interfaces for which specific types will be declared later in the programme's lifecyle. They increase the re-usability and readability of your code - for instance, you can write a function that will take more than one argument type without having to list every single one in its declaration, while still enforcing proper typing throughout.  

For instance: 

```
const identity<Type>(arg: Type) : Type {
    return arg; 
}
// => This is function can take and return any type of argument. It also captures the type provided when calling the function, as opposed, to, for example, the "any" type, which loses us access to that information. 

// => The argument and the return value of the function must both be of "Type" - this would be incorrect if our "Type" wasn't of number, and this wouldn't be great code as it's likely to break that rule: 

const identity<Type>(arg: Type) : Type {
    return 0; 
}

```
